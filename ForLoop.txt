A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax for this is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>

    expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling terminating flag for the loop.
    expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
    expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.

A sample loop will be

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}


SOLUTION:-

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a,b;
    string number[10] = {"zero","one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine"};
    cin >> a>>b;
    for(int i=a;i<=b;i++)
    {
        if(i >9)
        {
            cout<<(i%2==0?"even":"odd")<<endl;
        }
        else
        {cout<<number[i]<<endl;}
    }
    // Complete the code.
    return 0;
}
